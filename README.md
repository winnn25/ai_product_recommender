# E-commerce Recommendation Feature (Rule-Based) 🛒✨

A **rule-based product recommendation system** for an e-commerce app. When a user adds an item to the cart, 
it suggests **similar products by category & price**-no AI needed! Focus is on **clean frontend logic and smooth UX**.  


## How It Works ⚡
- Detects product added to cart  
- Filters items by **category** & **price range**  
- Shows recommendations in **real-time**  
- Updates automatically as cart changes  


## Key Concepts 🧠
- Rule-based filtering logic  
- Conditional rendering in React  
- Global state management with Redux  
- API-driven UI (FakeStoreAPI)  
- UX-focused, simple & predictable  


## Tech Stack 💻
React | Redux | JavaScript | FakeStoreAPI  


## Why Not AI? 🤖
- Transparent, easy to debug  
- Simple & fast for frontend use  
- Shows UX value without ML
